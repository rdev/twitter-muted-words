# Twitter Muted Words

This is the list of muted words I use to keep my Twitter clear of American politics, social politics, gender issues, natural disasters, gun violence, pissed off people, etc.

The list includes stuff I don't care or want to hear about for various reasons, and if inclusion of certain item offends someone - I'm not responsible for that.

This list includes [@sindresorhus's list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/twitter-mute-words)
